Certainly! I can help you with that. Below is an example of a Django website that takes a user's URL input and downloads a file from that URL. 

First, make sure you have Django installed. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install Django
```

Once Django is installed, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Django project:

```shell
django-admin startproject url_downloader
cd url_downloader
```

2. Create a new Django app within the project:

```shell
python manage.py startapp downloader
```

3. In the `downloader` directory, create a new file called `forms.py` and add the following code:

```python
from django import forms

class DownloadForm(forms.Form):
    url = forms.URLField(label='URL')
```

4. In the `downloader` directory, create a new file called `views.py` and add the following code:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
import requests

from .forms import DownloadForm

def download_file(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = DownloadForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            url = form.cleaned_data['url']
            response = requests.get(url)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                content = response.content
                # Do something with the downloaded content, e.g., save it to a file
                # For simplicity, we'll just return a response with the content
                return HttpResponse(content, content_type=response.headers['Content-Type'])
            else:
                form.add_error('url', 'Failed to download file')
    else:
        form = DownloadForm()
    return render(request, 'downloader/download.html', {'form': form})
```

5. In the `downloader` directory, create a new directory called `templates` and within it, create another directory called `downloader`. In the `downloader` directory, create a new file called `download.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>URL Downloader</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>URL Downloader</h1>
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form }}
        <button type="submit">Download</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

6. In the project's `urls.py` file, update the code to include the URL pattern for the downloader app. Replace the existing code with the following:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

from downloader.views import download_file

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('download/', download_file, name='download_file'),
]
```

7. Finally, run the Django development server:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

Now, you can access the URL downloader website at `http://localhost:8000/download/`. It will display a form where users can enter a URL. After submitting the form, the website will attempt to download the file from the provided URL.

Please note that this example doesn't handle all possible scenarios or implement error handling in depth. It serves as a starting point for your project, and you can expand upon it based on your specific requirements.
